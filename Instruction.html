                <li>Each row has a different number of points to be won indicated on the left
                    of each lane the opponent may have a different value indicated on the right</li>
                <li>Each turn you can place one card in a row until you run out of cards</li>
                Basic Rules: 

                <li>You can only place one card per turn</li>
                <li>Both players must decide where to place a card before
