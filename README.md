Card Game is a a web app that assists with online psychology studies.
In it's current form, Card Game is a one-player game where the user plays a series of game trials against a computer opponent at a simple multiple-goal oriented card game. 
The program runs on the [JATOS](https://www.jatos.org/) server and records various aspects of the player's performance in the game.

__To launch program:__
1.	Download the zipped files from the program repository and unzip the root folder.
2.	Run local or server installation of JATOS.
3.	Navigate to the server in your browser and log in to JATOS on being prompted.
4.	Select 'Import Study' from top of the page.
5.	Import 'card_game.zip' from the program root folder.
6.	Select 'Card Game’s from list of studies.
7.	Select run 'Card Game' .
__For further development:__
1.	Follow all the step above to run the current version of the game from JATOS.
2.	Edit files within the JATOS server 'study_assets_root/card_game' folder as necessary (note: not the ones in 'card_game.zip').
3.	After edits, running the study from JATOS will show you the updated game.
4.	Now export 'Card Game' from JATOS this will give you the new ’card_game.zip' (this export file contains a necessary JATOS file that is automatically generated when the study was created, hence this process).
5.	Push both the newly edited files from ‘study_assets_root/card_game’ and the new ‘card_game.zip’ to a Push all changes to repository (note: the study’s files are uploaded twice, once raw to allow GitHub to track commits and once zipped to allow JATOS to use its hidden file and so it can be easily imported).
