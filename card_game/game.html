          How to Play:

          <div class="small">
            <br />
            This is a two-player game. The aim of the game is to win as many
            points as possible in multiple game-trials.
            <div>
              <br />
              In each game-trial:
            </div>
            <li>Each row on the screen represents a 'goal'.</li>
            <li>
              Each 'goal' is worth a set of points (indicated on the left for
              player-1 and on the right for player-2).
            </li>
            <li>
              Each 'card' (at the bottom of the screen) holds a bidding-value
              shown on the card.
            </li>
            <li>
              Over multiple rounds, players place a single 'card' into a row to
              bid on a 'goal'.
            </li>
            <li>
              The numbers in the centre indicate the player's current total bid
              on a ‘goal’.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the last round, the player with the highest bid on a ‘goal’
              wins the points specified on it.
            </li>

            <br />The player with the highest points at the end wins the game.

          <br />Basic Rules:
          <div class="small">
            <br />
            <li>
              Each player has a set number of cards, configured at the beginning
              by the admin.
            </li>
            <li>A players must only place one card per round/turn.</li>
            <li>
              The other player's decision is only shown when both players end
              their turn.
            </li>
            <li>A trial will end when both players have no cards left.</li>
